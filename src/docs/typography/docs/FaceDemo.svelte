  As mass-printing technologies like the printing press spread, newspapers were
  established to provide increasingly literate audiences with the news. The
  first references to privately owned newspaper publishers in China date to the
  late Ming dynasty in 1582. Johann Carolus's Relation aller Fürnemmen und
  gedenckwürdigen Historien, published in 1605 in Strasbourg, is often
  recognized as the first newspaper in Europe.
