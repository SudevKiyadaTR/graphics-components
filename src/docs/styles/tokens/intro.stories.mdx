# Style tokens

The heart of the design system used to style all the components in this library is our style token system.

## What's a "token"?

A token represents the value for an individual style rule, like `font-weight`. Each token sets just one style rule so they can be combined together to style an element.

<Mermaid
  name="token-graph"
  code={`
graph LR;
  A(Token)-->|1rem|B;
  B(Style rule)-->|font-size|Y;
  C(Token)-->|bold|D;
  D(Style rule)-->|font-weight|Y;
  E(Token)-->|serif|F;
  F(Style rule)-->|font-family|Y;
  Y(HTML Element)-->|"&lt;div/&gt;"|Z("&lt;Component/&gt;");
`}
/>

Each token has several levels that represent the different variations of a style rule in our design system.

<Mermaid
  name="individual-graph"
  code={`
graph LR;
  TD[Text align tokens]-->TA;
  TD-->TB;
  TD-->TC;
  TA(text-left)-->TX["text-align: left;"];
  TB(text-center)-->TY["text-align: center;"];
  TC(text-right)-->TZ["text-align: right;"];
`}
/>

## Using style tokens

> Whether you use style tokens or write your own custom CSS in your project is **entirely up to you**.
>
> There are hundreds of tokens, so they can be a little daunting at first. But learning the tokens for the styles you have to write most often will absolutely save you time, so we recommend giving them a try.
>
> **That said**, we _do recommend_ using tokens for styling typography, especially `font-size`. Our typography size tokens responsively size the text on your page using a fluid scale so it will look great whether a reader is on a mobile phone or giant desktop.

All of our style tokens can be used through either a class name, an SCSS mixin or both. Use the tables throughout this section of the docs to see what's available for each token.

### For example...

Here's our table of text colour tokens, which has a few preset tokens for setting `text-color`.

<CopyTable
  title="Colour"
  mdnLink="color"
  header={['Class', 'Include', 'Properties']}
  body={cssStringToTableArray(color, true)}
  copyable={[true, (t) => `@include ${t};`, false]}
/>

This table's tokens can be used through both a class or an SCSS mixin. (The table lets you click to copy for either.)

To use the token that sets the text colour to our "primary text colour" (i.e., black), you'd use the `Class` token like this:

```svelte
<p class="text-primary">Lorem ipsum...</p>
```

If you'd like to set the style in SCSS, you'd use the `Include` token like this:

```svelte
<p>Lorem ipsum...</p>

<style lang="scss">
  @import '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components/dist/scss/mixins';

  p {
    @include text-primary;
  }
</style>
```

> **Note:** If you're writing SCSS _inside a component_, the `@import` above is required. If you're writing in `global.scss`, this is already included for you.

To use multiple tokens, you'd simply add another class or include:

```svelte
<p class="text-primary font-bold">Lorem ipsum...</p>
```

```scss
p {
  @include text-primary;
  @include font-bold;
}
```

It's normal that not every style is accounted for by our tokens, so expect you'll still have to write your own SCSS at times. But using the pre-made tokens will shortcut a lot of time spent tweaking styles to make designs consistent across your page. The styles set by our tokens have been pre-harmonised for you!
